        <p>
            Louisiana is located in the United States of America (USA) and was bought from the French during Thomas Jefferson's presidency.
            It included a lot more land, but was later narrowed down to one smaller state.
            The importance of this city, is that it was a port city that allowed for easy trade, shipping, and transportation.
            Today Louisiana is known for its rich Cajun and Creole heritage.
            People from all over the world come to visit and take a look at all of the places in Louisiana.
